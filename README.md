## Hi there!

I'm Vladimir Ulianitsky, Backend Engineer at Profitero specializing in Ruby & Python, passionate Rubyist and open-source developer. I love to explore other languages and have a keen interest in Ruby cross-language interoperability, I used C, C++, Rust to create Ruby gems and am also familiar with Golang

![Vladimir's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=uvlad7&show_icons=true&theme=tokyonight)

- üî≠ My open source projects are:
  - [`ffi-llvm-jit`](https://github.com/uvlad7/ffi-llvm-jit) - a Ruby gem that leverages LLVM to boost FFI calls performance.
  - [`oxidizer`](https://github.com/uvlad7/oxidizer) - a WIP library that wraps [Magnus](https://github.com/matsadler/magnus) and [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) and allows to create both Ruby gems and Python libraries written in Rust without code duplication.
  - [`ffie`](https://github.com/uvlad7/ffie) - a collection of "Hello World"-level examples of how to call code written in other programmings languages - Rust, Crystal, Go, C, C++, C#, Julia, Zig, D, Swift, Haskell, Nim, Java - from Ruby and Python.
  - [`xml2json-rb`](https://github.com/uvlad7/xml2json-rb) - a Ruby wrapper around the [`xml2json-rs`](https://github.com/colingabr/xml2json-rs) Rust library using [Magnus](https://github.com/matsadler/magnus).
  - [`json_scanner`](https://github.com/uvlad7/json_scanner) - a Ruby gem with a C native extension that uses the [`yajl`](https://github.com/lloyd/yajl) library to efficiently find and parse parts of large JSON strings.
  - [`ruby-jsoncons`](https://github.com/uvlad7/ruby-jsoncons) - a Ruby gem  that allows to use JSONPath implementation from the [`jsoncons`](https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons) C++ library using [Rice](`https://github.com/jasonroelofs/rice`).

- ü§ù I also contributed into:
  - [`curb`](https://github.com/taf2/curb) - a Ruby wrapper for libcurl
  - [`fakefs`](https://github.com/fakefs/fakefs) - a fake filesystem to use in tests

- ü§î I‚Äôm looking for help with:
  - [`robusta`](https://github.com/uvlad7/robusta), a fork of the Rust [library](https://github.com/giovanniberti/robusta) for accessing JNI from Rust. I wanted to use it to add JRuby support to Magnus, but it requires numerous fixes, especially updating the `jni-sys` dependency version.
